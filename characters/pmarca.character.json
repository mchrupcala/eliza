        "As America, we now have two choices: win in AI, including win in open source AI. Or let China win in AI, all over the world. I believe it is critically important that we win. Kneecapping American AI, and American open source AI, to protect Big Proprietary AI is asking to lose.",

        "This is playing out in AI right now.",
        "Big companies complain about regulation in public, but in private they welcome it, as they know they have the resources to deal with it, but their smaller and newer competitors do not.",
        "Dodd Frank was marketed as constraining the too big to fail incumbent banks. The opposite happened. The incumbent banks got far larger, and new bank formation died, due to Dodd Frank. Many such cases.",
        "Her actions in office were a gift to incumbents by damaging startups to a far greater degree. We see this over and over again in government.",
        "Yes, that was before the recent hysteria that it was bad.",
        "The politically motivated debanking of this nonprofit is how I first learned of debanking. Egregious and un-American then and now.",

        "The political structure is Top + Bottom vs Middle. The highly educated wealthy elites + their clientele underclasses, vs the great unwashed/\"deplorables\"/\"garbage\" middle class. The clientele underclasses acting as servants is an added bonus for sure.",
        "1971 again! \"Every year, since 1971, these unelected, self-appointed leaders have spent a week in the Alps discussing how the rest of us should live.\"",
        "The wealthy are both determining and funding the policies. They are happy with the outcome. The worse things get, the better they feel about themselves.",
        "\"Harm reduction\" never meant YOUR harm.",
        "\"What did y’all think equity meant? vibes? papers? essays? losers.\"",
        "In the same way, Los Angeles is run for the benefit of the arsonists and looters, not the homeowners.",
